==== Prepare your dev environment for java 11

- Use `alternatives` command to configure `java` and `javac` to version 11:
```console
$ sudo alternatives --config java

There are 4 programs which provide 'java'.

  Selection    Command
-----------------------------------------------
   1           java-latest-openjdk.x86_64 (/usr/lib/jvm/java-12-openjdk-12.0.1.12-1.rolling.fc30.x86_64/bin/java)
   2           java (/opt/jdk-9/bin/java)
   3           java-11-openjdk.x86_64 (/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.3.7-5.fc30.x86_64/bin/java)
*+ 4           java-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64 (/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.212.b04-0.fc30.x86_64/jre/bin/java)

```
- Maven >= 3.5 is required, download and extract if not installed using
distribution package management, and add to PATH.

Fedora 30
```console
$ sudo dnf module install maven
```

- verify your `mvn` version:
```console
$ mvn -v | head -1
Apache Maven 3.5.4 (Red Hat 3.5.4-5)

```

- export `JAVA_HOME` if `mvn` is not executing using java-11:
```console
#put this in your ~/.bashrc
$ export JAVA_HOME=/lib/jvm/java-11

$ mvn -v | grep "Java version: "
Java version: 11.0.4, vendor: Oracle Corporation, runtime: /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.4.11-0.fc30.x86_64
```

WildFly 15 is required along with ovirt-engine-wildfly-overlay. Preferred way
is to install following packages:

- ovirt-engine-wildfly
- ovirt-engine-wildfly-overlay

Both packages can be installed from ovirt-master-snapshot-static repository:

  [ovirt-master-snapshot-static]
  name=Latest oVirt master additional nightly snapshot
  baseurl=http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/ovirt-master-snapshot-static/rpm/@DIST@$releasever/
  enabled=1
  skip_if_unavailable=1
  gpgcheck=0

Please replace `@DIST@` with `fc` for Fedora or `el` for Centos/RHEL.

Alternatively, repository list can be updated using the following command:

  $ sudo yum install -y http://resources.ovirt.org/pub/yum-repo/ovirt-release-master.rpm

OVN/OVS is an optional dependency. If you want to use it, check the requirements in the
ovirt-engine.spec.in file for a list of packages. Otherwise, you should reply 'No'
when asked about it by engine-setup.

For Fedora prerequisites installation, following command can be applied:

  $ sudo yum install -y $(cat automation/check-patch.packages)

Install additional packages for Fedora:

  $ sudo yum install -y \
        ansible \
        ansible-runner-service-dev \
        bind-utils \
        libxml2-python \
        m2crypto \
        mailcap \
        openssl \
        ovirt-ansible-roles \
        ovirt-engine-metrics \
        ovirt-engine-wildfly \
        ovirt-engine-wildfly-overlay \
        ovirt-setup-lib \
        python2-daemon \
        python2-dateutil \
        python2-jinja2 \
        python-ovirt-engine-sdk4 \
        unzip

Optional packages for Fedora:

  $ sudo yum install -y \
        python2-docker-py \
        python2-flake8 \
        python2-isort \
        python2-pep8

==== System settings

Build locales requires at least 10240 file descriptors, create the
following file, replace <user> with user that is used for building,
and logout/login:

./etc/security/limits.d/10-nofile.conf
----
<user> hard nofile 10240
#<user> soft nofile 10240  # optional, to apply automatically
----

If soft limit was not set, before building, apply new limit using:

  $ ulimit -n 10240

Development environment by default uses ports 8080 (HTTP), 8443 (HTTPS), 8787
(java debug), and 54323 (ovirt-imageio-proxy) so make sure they are accessible
from the outside. For example:

    firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent
    firewall-cmd --add-port=8443/tcp --permanent
    firewall-cmd --add-port=8787/tcp --permanent
    firewall-cmd --add-port=54323/tcp --permanent

If you also want to connect to the database from the outside:

   firewall-cmd --add-port=5432/tcp --permanent

Finally, apply changes using:

    firewall-cmd --reload

If compiling in a virtual machine, javac might experience difficulties on guests with dynamically growing RAM so it's
better to have VM's starting allocation and maximum allocation set to the same value.

==== PostgreSQL accessibility

Initialize PostgreSQL configuration files:

  $ sudo postgresql-setup --initdb --unit postgresql # fedora

Configure PostgreSQL to accept user and password:

Locate `pg_hba.conf` within your distribution, common locations are:

- `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf`
- `/etc/postgresql-*/pg_hba.conf`
- `/etc/postgresql/*/main/pg_hba.conf`

Within `pg_hba.conf` set method to `password` for `127.0.0.1/32` and
`::1/128` for IPv4 and IPv6 local connections correspondingly.

If you want to make postgres accessible from the outside, change `127.0.0.1/32` to `0.0.0.0/0` and `::1/128` to `::/0`.

Tune PostgreSQL configuration:
Locate `postgresql.conf` within your distribution, common locations are:

- `/var/lib/pgsql/data`
- `/etc/postgresql*`

Within `postgresql.conf` make sure following values are set:

  max_connections = 150
  work_mem = 8MB
  autovacuum_max_workers = 6
  autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.01
  autovacuum_analyze_scale_factor = 0.075
  maintenance_work_mem = 64MB

If you want to connect from the outside, set also:

  listen_addresses = '*'

Enable and start (`systemctl enable postgresql --now`).

==== Database creation

Create database for ovirt-engine, usually the following sequence should
work to create a user named `engine` that owns database named `engine`:

  # su - postgres -c "psql -d template1"
  template1=# create user engine password 'engine';
  template1=# drop database engine;
  template1=# create database engine owner engine template template0
  encoding 'UTF8' lc_collate 'en_US.UTF-8' lc_ctype 'en_US.UTF-8';
  template1=# \q

Enable uuid-ossp extension for the database:

  # su - postgres -c "psql -d engine"
  engine=# CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp";
  engine=# \q

==== Ansible Runner Service configration

Since oVirt 4.4 the engine is integrated with Ansible Runner Service. To properly integrate the development
environment with the Ansible Runner Service, you need to edit `/etc/ansible-runner-service/config.yaml` file
as follows:

  ---
  playbooks_root_dir: '$PREFIX/share/ovirt-engine/ansible-runner-service-project'
  ssh_private_key: '$PREFIX/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/keys/engine_id_rsa'
  port: 50001
  target_user: root

Please replace `$PREFIX` with the real path of your development environment, which you've specified during
the compilation of the engine, for example:

  playbooks_root_dir: '/home/user/ovirt-engine/share/ovirt-engine/ansible-runner-service-project'
  ssh_private_key: '/home/user/ovirt-engine/etc/pki/ovirt-engine/keys/engine_id_rsa'


After edditing the file, make sure you've restarted the Ansible Runner Service service:

  # systemctl restart ansible-runner-service
  # systemctl enable ansible-runner-service

=== Development

==== Environment

Development environment is supported only under non-root account. Do
not run this sequence as root.

Each instance of application must be installed at different `PREFIX` and
use its own database. Throughout this document application is installed
using `PREFIX="${PREFIX}"` and engine database and user, these should be
changed if a new instance is required. Do not mix different versions of
product with same `PREFIX/database`.

From this point on, the `"${PREFIX}"` will be used to mark the prefix
in which you selected to install the development environment.

==== Build

To build and install ovirt-engine at your home folder under ovirt-engine
directory execute the following command:

  $ make clean install-dev PREFIX="${PREFIX}"

NOTE: `${PREFIX}` should be replaced with the location in which you
intend to install the environment.

NOTE: Add SKIP_CHECKS=1 to disable tests.

===== Build targets

all:: Build project.
clean:: Clean project.
all-dev:: Build project for development.
install-dev:: Install a development environment at PREFIX.
dist:: Create source tarball out of git repository.
maven:: Force execution of maven.
generated-files:: Create file from templates (.in files).
+
  When creating new templates, generated files will be automatically appears in .gitignore, updated .gitignore should be part of commiting new templates.


===== Build customization

The following `Makefile` environment variables are available for build
customization:

PREFIX:: Installation root directory. Default is `/usr/local`.

BUILD_GWT:: Build GWT. Default is `1`.

BUILD_ALL_USER_AGENTS:: Build GWT applications for all supported
browsers. Default is `0`.

BUILD_LOCALES:: Build GWT applications for all supported locales.
default is `0`.

BUILD_DEV:: Add extra development flags. Usually this should not be
used directly, as the all-dev sets this. Default is `0`.

BUILD_UT:: Perform unit tests during build. Default is `0`.

BUILD_JAVA_OPTS_MAVEN:: Maven JVM options. Can be defined as
environment variable. Default is empty.

BUILD_JAVA_OPTS_GWT:: GWT compiler and dev mode JVM options. Can be
defined as environment variable. default is empty.

NOTE: Note that `BUILD_JAVA_OPTS_GWT` overrides `BUILD_JAVA_OPTS_MAVEN`
when building GWT applications (`BUILD_JAVA_OPTS_MAVEN` settings still
apply, unless overridden).

DEV_BUILD_GWT_DRAFT:: Build "draft" version of GWT applications without
optimizations. This is useful when profiling compiled applications in
web browser. Default value is `0`.
+
Following changes are applied for draft builds:
- Prevent code and CSS obfuscation.
- Reduce the level of code optimizations.
+
On local development environment, using GWT Super Dev Mode (see below)
is preferred, as it automatically disables all optimizations and allows
you to recompile the GWT application on the fly.
+

DEV_BUILD_GWT_SUPER_DEV_MODE:: Allows debugging GWT applications via
Super Dev Mode, using web browser's JavaScript development tooling.
Default value is `1`.
+
Do a local Engine development build as you normally would. Then, start
the Super Dev Mode code server as following:

  $ make gwt-debug DEV_BUILD_GWT_SUPER_DEV_MODE=1

In your browser, open http://127.0.0.1:9876/ and save the "Dev Mode On"
bookmark. Next, visit the GWT application URL (as served from Engine)
and click "Dev Mode On". This allows you to recompile and reload the
GWT application, reflecting any changes you've made in the UI code.

DEV_EXTRA_BUILD_FLAGS:: Any maven build flags required for building.
+
For example, if your machine is low on memory, limit maximum
simultaneous GWT permutation worker threads:
+
  DEV_EXTRA_BUILD_FLAGS="-Dgwt.compiler.localWorkers=1"

DEV_EXTRA_BUILD_FLAGS_GWT_DEFAULTS:: Any maven build flags required for building GWT applications.
+
By default, GWT applications are
built for Firefox only. To build for additional browsers, provide
comma-separated list of user agents, see
`frontend/webadmin/modules/pom.xml` for full list.
+
For example, to build for Firefox and Chrome:
+
  DEV_EXTRA_BUILD_FLAGS_GWT_DEFAULTS="-Dgwt.userAgent=gecko1_8,safari"
+
To build for all supported browsers, use `BUILD_ALL_USER_AGENTS=1`.
+
For example, to build only the English and Japanese locale:
+
  DEV_EXTRA_BUILD_FLAGS_GWT_DEFAULTS="-Dgwt.locale=en_US,ja_JP"
+
To build for all supported locales, use `BUILD_LOCALES=1`.

+
For example to build engine without obfuscated Javascript code:
+
    DEV_EXTRA_BUILD_FLAGS_GWT_DEFAULTS="-Dgwt.style=pretty"
+

+
To build engine without obfuscated CSS styles:
+
    DEV_EXTRA_BUILD_FLAGS_GWT_DEFAULTS="-Dgwt.cssResourceStyle=pretty"
+

DEV_REBUILD:: Disable if only packaging components were modified.
Default is `1`.

PY_VERSION:: Python defaults to python3 if available, use PY_VERSION=2
in order to override. +
This options affects various services and several features written in python.

NOTE: `engine-setup` which runs otopi, uses different customized variable `OTOPI_PYTHON`


WILDFLY_OVERLAY_MODULES:: Change location of WildFly overlay modules.
If you want to disable WildFly overlay configuration completely, please
set to empty string. Default is
`/usr/share/ovirt-engine-wildfly-overlay/modules`.

=== Setup

To setup the product use the following command:

  $ "${PREFIX}/bin/engine-setup"

NOTE: otopi, and therefore engine-setup, now defaults to python3 except el7, use: +
`$  OTOPI_PYTHON=/usr/bin/python2 "${PREFIX}/bin/engine-setup"` +
to override.

During engine setup, a certificate has to be issued and you will be asked for a
hostname. If you want to upload and download images from administration portal,
it has to be the name by which your machine is accessible from the outside.

=== JBoss

If you want to use different WildFly/EAP installation, specify it at
`--jboss-home=` parameter of setup.

=== Environment

OVIRT_ENGINE_JAVA_HOME:: Select a specific Java home.

OVIRT_ENGINE_JAVA_HOME_FORCE:: Set to non zero to bypass Java
compatibility check.

=== Refresh

If there are no significant changes, such as file structure or database
schema, there is no need to run the setup again, `make install-dev
<args>` will overwrite files as required, run `engine-setup` to refresh
database schema.

Do remember to restart the engine service.

If there is a significant change, safest path is to stop service, remove
`${PREFIX}` directory, build and setup.

The `${PREFIX}/bin/engine-cleanup` tool is also available to cleanup the
environment, it is useful for application changes, less for packaging
changes.

=== Service administration

Most utilities and services are operational, including PKI, host deploy.

To start/stop the engine service use:

  $ "${PREFIX}/share/ovirt-engine/services/ovirt-engine/ovirt-engine.py" start

While the service is running, this command will not exit. Press
<Ctrl>-C to stop service.

Access using HTTP or HTTPS:

- http://<server>:8080
- https://<server>:8443

=== Remote debug

By default, debug address is `127.0.0.1:8787`. If you want to make engine accessible to the remote debugger, after
running engine-setup edit the following file: ${PREFIX}/etc/ovirt-engine/engine.conf.d/10-setup-protocols.conf:

 ENGINE_DEBUG_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8787

=== Running instance management (JMX)

ovirt-engine service supports jmx as management interface. Actually, this is
the standard jboss jmx interface, while authentication can be done using any
engine user with SuperUser role. Access is permitted only from the local
host.

Access JMX shell using provide OPTIONAL_COMMAND for non interactive usage:

  $ "${JBOSS_HOME}/bin/jboss-cli.sh" \
    --connect \
    --timeout=30000 \
    --controller=localhost:8706 \
    --user=admin@internal \
    --commands="OPTIONAL_COMMA_SEPARATED_COMMANDS"

Useful commands:

Modify log level::
+
  /subsystem=logging/logger=org.ovirt.engine.core.bll:write-attribute(name=level,value=DEBUG)

Create a new log category::
+
  /subsystem=logging/logger=org.ovirt.engine:add

Get the engine data-source statistics::
+
  ls /subsystem=datasources/data-source=ENGINEDataSource/statistics=jdbc/

Get threading info::
+
  ls /core-service=platform-mbean/type=threading/

By default JMX access is available only to localhost, to open JMX to
world, add `${PREFIX}/etc/ovirt-engine/engine.conf.d/20-setup-jmx-debug.conf` with:

  ENGINE_JMX_INTERFACE=public

=== DAO tests

Create empty database for DAO tests refer to <<Database creation>>.

Provided user is `engine`, password is `engine` and database is
`engine_dao_tests`.

  $ PGPASSWORD=engine \
    ./packaging/dbscripts/schema.sh \
      -c apply -u engine -d engine_dao_tests

Run build as:

  $ make maven BUILD_GWT=0 BUILD_UT=1 EXTRA_BUILD_FLAGS="-P enable-dao-tests \
    -D engine.db.username=engine \
    -D engine.db.password=engine \
    -D engine.db.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost/engine_dao_tests"

=== VM console

After the environment is setup and installed, some adjustments are required.

Copy `vmconsole-host` configuration:

  $ sudo cp -p "${PREFIX}/share/ovirt-engine/conf/ovirt-vmconsole-proxy.conf \
  /etc/ovirt-vmconsole/ovirt-vmconsole-proxy/conf.d/50-ovirt-vmconsole-proxy.conf

If selinux is enabled on your machine, set type on vmconsole helper using:

$ sudo chcon --type=bin_t "${PREFIX}/libexec/ovirt-vmconsole-proxy-helper/ovirt-vmconsole-list.py"

=== ovirt-imageio

After setup, you need to run ovirt-imageio manually if you want to upload and
download images via the administration portal. To run ovirt-imageio, run the
following command:

  $ ovirt-imageio --conf-dir $PREFIX/etc/ovirt-imageio

This assumes you have installed `ovirt-imageio-daemon` and you have run `engine-setup`.

In development mode, ovirt-imageio logs to stderr using DEBUG level. If you
would like to log to a file create a log directory:

  $ mkdir $PREFIX/var/log/ovirt-imageio

And install a drop-in configuration file to override engine developement setup:

  $ cat $PREFIX/etc/ovirt-imageio/conf.d/99-local.conf
  [handlers]
  keys = logfile

  [logger_root]
  handlers = logfile

  [handler_logfile]
  args = ('/home/username/ovirt-engine/log/ovirt-imageio/daemon.log',)

=== RPM packaging

  $ make dist
  $ rpmbuild -ts @tarball@
  # yum-builddep @srpm@
  # rpmbuild -tb @tarball@

The following spec file variables are available for package customization:

ovirt_build_quick:: Quick build, best for syntax checks. Default is `0`.

ovirt_build_minimal:: Build minimal Firefox only package. Default is
`0`.

ovirt_build_user_agent:: When using quick or minimal build, build only
for this user agent. Default is `gecko1_8` (Firefox). To build for
Chrome use `safari`.

ovirt_build_gwt:: Build GWT components. Default is `1`.

ovirt_build_all_user_agents:: Build GWT components for all supported
browsers. Default is `1`.

ovirt_build_locales:: Build GWT components for all supported locales.
Default is `1`.

Examples:

Build minimal rpm package for Firefox::

    $ rpmbuild -D"ovirt_build_minimal 1" -tb @tarball@

Build minimal rpm package for Chrome or Safari::

    $ rpmbuild -D"ovirt_build_minimal 1" -D"ovirt_build_user_agent safari" -tb @tarball@
